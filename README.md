## Wobbly Life Newspaper job:

- Enter newspaper job room and stand to the owner's left (Don't press Y yet)
- Run `python invoke_recording_repeat.py "news5"` and quickly focus the Xbox app window
- Pressing CTRL C will make the program stop after its next execution

## PvZ Bot:

- Spawn in as a character, then run `python ai_test.py` and quickly focus the Xbox app window
- When the match ends, quickly focus on the running PowerShell window and use CTRL C to stop the program

## Disclaimer:

- The robot does not intelligently interact with its environment, it simply plays prerecorded inputs at infinitum. Thus, it is in no way able to be used for aimbot or ESP hacks.
